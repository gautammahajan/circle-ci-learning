--------------  Collecting Test Metadata ------------------

CircleCI to output test metadata as XML for some common test runners and store reports with the store_test_results step.

- store_test_results:
    path: test-results

Where the path key is an absolute or relative path to your working_directory containing subdirectories of JUnit XML or Cucumber JSON test metadata files

Circle ci publishes test results to insights or pushes it to artifacts
