No conditional checking --> if , for , switch
No exposeVars -->
Similar to expose vars --> no way to declare json structure at variable section and use it in other flows



Circle ci has hold -- manual approaval of job -- user has to explicitly go to UI and approve the job
then subsequent jobs starts working


There is no inline var declaration, shell script executes and assigns value declared variable
var(derived) : shell script


Sometimes tool installation takes time in out set-up, Circle-ci provides pre-configured images where tools are already set-up


Cache size difference --> 500 mb max
Circle ci provides way to cache any directory --> our set-up caches only node-modules/.m2
but circle-ci has option to provide

Circle ci caches .git, cache key is based on revision, if revision has not changed and job is getting triggered/build from UI
It saves the time to fetch git repo


No inheritance model in circle-ci.
Plus execution of job from A to B

Besides actual artifacts [.jar, .apk etc] text/html/pdf docs are also uploaded, plus directory as well
use store_artifacts step and mention the path of doc/directory

Hygiea shows build history -- graph
plus sonar-scan results per build


Haven't seen sonar-scan in circle-ci

There is no multi-branch concept. For every created branch, workflow runs.
within workflow, we can add branch constraints --> which branches allowded /ignored

Test-suite runs parallel based parallelism given.
